# Chained Resource Discovery

Automatically discovers resources as configured in the config.json file.
If no configuration file exists, the config.default.json file will be used as a template.

The default configuration satisfies the original purpose of this mod. If an critter egg is discovered, the baby and adult critter will automatically be discovered. If a critter is discovered first the egg will be discovered.
